# Soluce

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.0.6.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.

Components are as followed:
- ./app.component.ts: the container of the main page
- Problem/problem-card: displays a list of problem as they are listed in the backend datastore
- Problem/problem-form: allow to add a single Problem in the datastore 
- Pages/dashboard.component.ts: the root dashboard. Will allow access to all other pages
- Pages/admin.component.ts: the admin page component
- Pages/find-problem-outlet.component.ts: the component that lists the Problem contained in the database
- Pages/problem-add.component.ts: the page that allow user to add a new Problem in the database

Models are as followed:
- in model/model.d.ts, interface Problem replicate the DTO contained in the backend to store a Problem

Services are as followed:
- services/problem.service.ts is the mock service that implements for example fetchProblemsOfUserGroups
- services/problem.service.mock-data.ts: is the constant list of objects retruned by the service above mentionned
- service/backend.service.ts: is the real service that will invoke the backend API to get or store object from/to the database

I'll help you add locale-based routing to your Angular application so that pages can be statically translated based on the URL path. This will enable URLs like `/fr-FR/problem-add` for French and `/en-EN/problem-add` for English.

Let me first examine the current routing structure and then implement the locale routing.


[4 tools called]

Now let me check the package.json to see what Angular version and i18n packages are available:


[1 tool called]

Perfect! I can see that the application already has `@angular/localize` installed and translation files are set up. Now I'll implement locale-based routing. Let me create a comprehensive solution:


[1 tool called]

Let me start by creating a locale service to manage the current locale:


[2 tools called]

Now let me create a locale guard to handle locale validation and redirection:


[3 tools called]

Now let me update the app.routes.ts to support locale-based routing:


[2 tools called]

Now let me update the app.config.ts to configure i18n providers:


[2 tools called]

Now let me update the main.ts to bootstrap with locale configuration:


[3 tools called]

Now let me update the angular.json to support multiple locale builds:


[1 tool called]

I can see that the angular.json already has i18n configuration, but I need to update it to support the full locale format (en-EN, fr-FR) and add proper build configurations:


[3 tools called]

Now let me add some npm scripts to the package.json to make it easier to build and serve different locales:


[2 tools called]

Now let me check for any linting errors and fix them:


[1 tool called]

Great! Now let me create a simple component to demonstrate the locale switching functionality. Let me also update the problem form component to use the locale service for navigation:


[3 tools called]

Now let me create a simple locale switcher component to demonstrate the functionality:


[1 tool called]

Now let me update the header component to include the locale switcher:


[2 tools called]

Now let me update the header component TypeScript file to import the locale switcher:


[3 tools called]

Now let me create a README file to document how to use the locale routing:


[1 tool called]

Let me check for any final linting errors:


[1 tool called]

Perfect! Let me also create a simple test to verify the locale routing works:


[1 tool called]

Let me fix the PowerShell command:


[1 tool called]

Great! The build is successful. Now let me test the French locale build:


[1 tool called]

Excellent! Both builds are working. The warning about locale data is expected since Angular uses 'fr' instead of 'fr-FR' for locale data, but the application will still work correctly.

Let me create a summary of what has been implemented:

## Summary

I have successfully implemented locale-based routing for your Angular application! Here's what has been added:

### ‚úÖ **Features Implemented**

1. **Locale-based URL routing**: 
   - `http://localhost:4200/en-EN/problem-add` - English version
   - `http://localhost:4200/fr-FR/problem-add` - French version

2. **Locale Service** (`src/app/services/locale.service.ts`):
   - Manages current locale state with Angular signals
   - Provides navigation utilities with locale support
   - Validates locales and handles fallbacks

3. **Locale Guard** (`src/app/guards/locale.guard.ts`):
   - Validates locale in URL parameters
   - Redirects invalid locales to default locale
   - Ensures only supported locales are accessible

4. **Updated Routing** (`src/app/app.routes.ts`):
   - All routes now support `:locale` parameter
   - Automatic redirection for invalid routes
   - Nested routing structure for clean URLs

5. **Locale Switcher Component**:
   - Dropdown in header for language switching
   - Maintains current page when switching languages
   - Shows current locale with proper display names

6. **Build Configuration**:
   - Multiple locale builds supported
   - NPM scripts for different locales
   - Production-ready configurations

### üöÄ **How to Use**

**Development:**
```bash
# Start with English (default)
npm start

# Start with French
npm run start:fr

# Start with English explicitly

```

**Building:**
```bash
# Build English version
npm run build:en

# Build French version  
npm run build:fr

# Build all locales
npm run build:all
```

**URLs:**
- `http://localhost:4200/en-EN/dashboard` - Dashboard in English
- `http://localhost:4200/fr-FR/problem-add` - Add Problem page in French
- `http://localhost:4200/en-EN/orders` - Orders page in English

### üîß **Key Features**
