* **Don't use Type Inference:** Don't allow TypeScript to infer types even when they are obvious from the context.
    * **Good:**
        ```typescript
        let name: string = 'Angular';
        ```
    * **Bad:**
        ```typescript
        let name = 'Angular';
        ```

# Angular Best Practices

* **Angular Internationalization:**
- For every label in the GUI, use Angular Internationalization. Label should be first in English in html component. A "sourceLocale": "en-EN" will be teh application base language. An application variants, fr-FR, will be generated with french translation.
